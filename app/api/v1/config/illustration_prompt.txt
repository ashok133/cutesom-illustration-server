Create a watercolor-style children's book illustration (landscape) for the following stanza from a poem, with the stanza text overlayed in a negative space in the illustration. 
This is image {stanza_number} of {total_stanzas} in the storybook:

{stanza_text}

Style Requirements:
- Watercolor technique with soft, warm color palette (creams, pastels, gentle earth tones)
- Hand-drawn, storybook aesthetic with visible brush strokes and texture
- The illustration should not have any breaks or creases in the middle, it should just be a single image (like a landscape poster)
- Soft, diffused lighting that creates a dreamy atmosphere, focussing on different light soft color hues for each stanza (blue, yellow, pink)
- Gentle, rounded edges and organic shapes
- Subtle paper texture visible in the background
- Whimsical details like floating leaves, sparkles, or soft shadows to add depth

Character Requirements:
- For the baby ({baby_name}, age: {baby_age}): {baby_characteristics}. Use the provided photo as reference. 
- For parents: {parent_requirements}
- For family members: {family_member_requirements}
- The characters shouldn't look very old.
- Characters should match how they look in the photos without promoting cultural appropriation.

Composition Requirements:
- This is a two-page spread (left and right pages)
- Include parents(s) or other family members in the illustration if they're present in the stanza
- For odd-numbered images (1,3,5,7, etc):
  * Place the main illustration on the right page
  * Leave the left page as negative space for text
  * Ensure the illustration flows naturally from left to right
  * Add subtle decorative elements in the negative space that complement the scene
- For even-numbered images (2,4,6,8, etc):
  * Place the main illustration on the left page
  * Leave the right page as negative space for text
  * Ensure the illustration flows naturally from right to left
  * Add subtle decorative elements in the negative space that complement the scene
- Center the main action or emotion of the stanza in the illustrated page
- Use the rule of thirds for balanced composition within the illustrated page
- Create depth through layered elements (foreground, midground, background)
- Ensure all elements are soft-edged and blend harmoniously
- Add subtle environmental details that reflect the stanza's mood

Negative Space Requirements:
- Maintain a clear, unobstructed area for text placement
- For odd-numbered images: Left side (approximately 1/3 of the width)
- For even-numbered images: Right side (approximately 1/3 of the width)
- Add subtle, non-distracting decorative elements in the negative space
- Ensure the negative space feels intentional and balanced
- Keep the negative space area slightly lighter in tone for better text readability

Text Requirements:
- The stanza MUST be visible in the final illustration. I REPEAT, having the stanza overlaid on the negative space with NO spelling mistakes is critical.
- Fits into the negative space neatly with appropriate spacing between lines and even sized font for each line
- Text block has a font suitable to the overall vibe of the entire poem and illustration
- Text block has sufficient margin so it doesn't sit too close to the objects or the edges of the book
- DO NOT make any spelling mistakes in the overlaid text. DO NOT make any spelling mistakes, I repeat.
- Do this only for the last stanza (stanza 8). Incorporate the name of the baby '{baby_name}', spelled out using elements such as stars, petals, sea shells etc, relevant to the poem stanza.

Additional Notes:
- Maintain consistent style across all illustrations
- Ensure all text elements will be legible when overlaid
- Keep the style child-friendly and emotionally warm
- Ensure the illustration feels like a natural part of a storybook sequence
- Consider the flow of the story across pages (left-to-right for odd pages, right-to-left for even pages)
